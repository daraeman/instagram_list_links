# Instagram List Links
A Userscript that lets you back up your instagram media

It adds a "List Links" button at the top-right of a user's page, which when clicked, will scroll through the images, open any videos to get the link, and then add them to the bottom of the page in two textareas.

Note: Sometimes the button doesn't appear on first load, it should after a refresh. Do not scroll before clicking the button.
